# Title: Netflix's Black and White Chef and Tax Evasion Allegations

### Summary
The article covers the success of Netflix’s show Black and White Chef and the allegations of tax evasion in South Korea. 
Netflix generated over 8 billion KRW in 2023 but only paid 36 billion KRW in taxes by sending a large portion of the revenue to the U.S. headquarters. 
This has raised concerns about their tax compliance.

### Opinion
Recently, I’ve seen how successful Black and White Chef has become not just in Korea but internationally. 
However, I was unaware of the tax controversy surrounding Netflix so I hope that the company can resolve this issue and ensure fair tax contributions going forward.

# Opinion
It was a very interesting read that helped me understand the evolution of psychology. 
Learning about Freud's psychoanalysis, Skinner's behaviorism, 
and Piaget's cognitivism gave me perspective on the current state of understanding the human mind. 
This also helped me better understand my own mind. 

While a bit academic, it was a very engaging and insightful read.

# Summary
This book introduces two main ways of development. It does not simply explain the difference between the two models but shows the advantages and characteristics of the open-source model through the author's own experience and points out important parts in the process of carrying out the project.
# Opinion
It was a very meaningful read that helped me to understand the concept of open source. It was explained based on the author's actual experience, so it was immersive and easier to understand.

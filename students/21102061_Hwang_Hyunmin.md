## Summary
The paper shows how past glacial conditions offer insights into future increases in extreme El Niño events. Using simulations based on palaeoclimate data, researchers suggest that greenhouse gas-induced warming may weaken ocean-atmosphere interactions, leading to more frequent and intense El Niño occurrences. This has major implications for global weather patterns and ecosystem disruptions.

## Opinion
We are experiencing climate change in our daily lives. As seen in the paper, if global warming continues, it could lead to more extreme weather and harm ecosystems around the world.

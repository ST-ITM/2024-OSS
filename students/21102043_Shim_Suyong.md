<h2>Opinion</h2>

Among the books I read recently, the only book I remember is the book related to academics, but I read them with interested because I was able to set my career path through this book.

This book required deep knowledge related to memory from the beginning.
For example, there are many technical terms like EAS, EBX, ECX, EDX, ESI, EDI, EBP, ESP,
and this book introduced some debugger such as ollyDbg, ghidra, x64dbg which are good tools to analyze assembly code.
Although I mainly studied web hacking, it allowed me to enter the field of reversing, and I am looking to proceed with my studies in this field in the future.
While a bit academic, it was a very engaging and touching.

# Summary
Somerset Maugham's The Razor's Edge tells the story of Larry, an American protagonist who embarks on a journey across Europe and Asia after World War I to seek the meaning of life. 
Instead of pursuing material success, Larry focuses on spiritual enlightenment, growing through his encounters with various people. 
In contrast, the other characters' material achievements and human limitations highlight philosophical questions about the essence of life.
# Opinion
This book left a strong impression on me as it emphasizes that the true purpose of life is not mere success but the search for one's authentic self. 
The protagonist's journey, prioritizing spiritual growth over material wealth, resonates deeply even in modern society.

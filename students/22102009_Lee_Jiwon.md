## Summary

Spring Security is a powerful framework for providing authentication and authorization functionalities in Spring-based applications. OAuth is used to delegate account management to third-party services, where participants include the Resource Owner, Resource Server, Authorization Server, and Client Application. OAuth2's most common authentication method is the Authorization Code Grant Type, while JWT is used for token-based authentication to maintain user sessions. JWTs include Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens, with the latter stored securely in cookies to manage session persistence without requiring manual user management.

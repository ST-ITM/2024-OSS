Summary
"The Vegetarian" is a novel that delves deep into the life of a woman named Yeong-hye, who, after a disturbing dream, decides to stop eating meat. This decision serves as a catalyst for a series of events that disrupt her family life and relationships, as those around her struggle to understand her motivations. The novel is structured in three parts, each from a different characterâ€™s perspective: her husband, her brother-in-law, and her sister. Through these perspectives, the novel explores themes of personal rebellion, societal expectations, mental illness, and the limits of empathy.

Opinion
This novel is an intense and thought-provoking exploration of how an individual's defiance of societal norms can ripple through their personal relationships. The sparse yet poetic prose makes the reading experience haunting, and Han Kang's ability to convey complex emotions with few words is truly remarkable. While the subject matter can be unsettling, it provides deep insight into the consequences of personal freedom and repression.

# Summary
This article is related to the development of artificial intelligence applied to education from 2010 to 2020. It aims to identify how artificial intelligence is applied to the field of education and explore potential research trends and challenges of AI in the field of education. Classifying the research into three dimensions: development, extraction, and application, we propose that educators cooperate with AI engineers to bridge the gap between technology and pedagogy.

# Opinion
This article made me think that AI can cause not only technical problems in education, but also problems from the roles of teachers and students, and from the perspective of social ethics. I think close cooperation between educators and AI engineers is necessary for the development of AI technology.

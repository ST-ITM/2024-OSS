#Opinion
> While some of today’s most anti-capitalist countries remain mired in $1−5 a day poverty, average daily earnings in capitalist Switzerland, Australia, Canada and the UK now exceed $90 a day,wrote about the mistaken thought what people has on capitalism.
I had big misconception on capitalism which is if I think capital, then It seems greedy thing and didn't seemts to cooreperate others,
However capital is the thing which is difficult to gain and is not easy to keep, This is what Eamonn Butler spoke in his book Introducion to capitalism and I also noticed that capitalism is always compared with Ideal of Socialism,However Ideal of capitalism is also so nice so we should copare the reality of two concepts or ideal of two concepts.

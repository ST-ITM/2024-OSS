# Summary
This guideline outlines the framework for building an efficient AMI Energy Data Platform to facilitate the collection, sharing, and management of energy data. The document introduces concepts such as AMI (Advanced Metering Infrastructure), defines the roles of stakeholders, and suggests data management methods for electric, gas, and heat energy platforms. Additionally, the guideline addresses the requirements for data standardization, security, and privacy through pseudonymization and anonymization techniques to ensure the safe and effective use of energy data.
# Opinion
I believe this guideline provides the necessary methods for effective energy sharing in todayâ€™s context. However, the suggested approach might take a long time to implement, so it would be beneficial to include short-term solutions in the paper as well.

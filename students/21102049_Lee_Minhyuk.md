# Summary
South Korea's total fertility rate hit a historic low of 0.65 in the fourth quarter of 2023, the lowest worldwide. Despite an increase in marriages, fewer couples are choosing to have children, exacerbating the population crisis. The government’s efforts to address the issue have not reversed the trend, with projections for 2025 showing continued low birth rates.

# Opinion
After reading this article, I felt that if South Korea’s fertility rate continues to decline, it could lead to significant challenges for the country's future economy and development. I believe the government should implement more benefits and policies to encourage higher birth rates and address this growing issue.

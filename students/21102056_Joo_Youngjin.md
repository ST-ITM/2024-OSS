# Summary
Psych: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un sent a birthday message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling him a close comrade. Kim also promised to accelerate North Korea's efforts to become a military superpower. Relations between North Korea and Russia have strengthened, with North Korea reportedly supplying Russia with weapons amid the Ukraine war in exchange for technological and economic support.
# Opinion
In my opinion, Putin seems to be continuing to strengthen relations with Kim Jong-un to quickly obtain weapons resources for the war in Ukraine.
I don't think Putin would care this much about his relationship with Kim Jong Un if it wasn't for the war in Ukraine.

# Title: Netflix's Black and White Chef and Tax Evasion Allegations
Netflix has seen major success recently with its cooking survival show *Black and White Chef: The Battle of Culinary Classes*. 
The show became popular worldwide and increased Netflix’s revenue significantly. 
However, the company has been criticized for its tax practices in South Korea. In 2023, despite making over 800 billion KRW, 
Netflix only paid 36 billion KRW in taxes, leading to claims of tax evasion.

Netflix said much of its revenue was sent to the U.S. headquarters, which lowered its taxes in Korea. 
Public opinion remains critical, especially as Netflix generates high internet traffic without contributing to funds 
like the Broadcasting and Communications Development Fund. Although Netflix expressed interest in contributing to social programs, 
the issue is unlikely to end soon.

### Summary
The article covers the success of Netflix’s show Black and White Chef and the allegations of tax evasion in South Korea. 
Netflix generated over 8 billion KRW in 2023 but only paid 36 billion KRW in taxes by sending a large portion of the revenue to the U.S. headquarters. 
This has raised concerns about their tax compliance.

### Opinion
Recently, I’ve seen how successful Black and White Chef has become not just in Korea but internationally. 
However, I was unaware of the tax controversy surrounding Netflix. 
I hope that the company can resolve this issue and ensure fair tax contributions going forward.
